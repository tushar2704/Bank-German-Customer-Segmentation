# Bank Customer Segmentation


Welcome to the Bank Customer Segmentation project! This project aims to revolutionize the way banks market to their customers by leveraging machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their account history, credit scores, and demographics. By gaining insights into distinct customer groups, banks can tailor their marketing and customer acquisition strategies for optimal results.

## Project Overview

In this project, we build a machine learning model using algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models to segment bank customers using the Bank Customer Segmentation dataset. This allows us to uncover meaningful patterns in customer behavior and preferences, leading to data-driven decisions for marketing strategies.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-customer-segmentation.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Dataset:** Download the Bank Customer Segmentation dataset and place it in the `data` directory.

4. **Data Preprocessing:** Use the provided Jupyter notebooks to preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and transform features for analysis.

5. **Algorithm Implementation:** Implement the machine learning algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models using the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.

6. **Segment Profiling:** Analyze the characteristics of each segment to derive insights. Visualizations and statistics can be generated using the tools provided in the notebooks.

7. **Strategy Formulation:** Based on the insights gained from segment profiling, develop personalized marketing and customer acquisition strategies for each segment.
